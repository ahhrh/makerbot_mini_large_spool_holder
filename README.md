# MakerBit Mini Large Spool Holder
Makerbot Mini mount for a large spool, external to the mini's chassis.  This allows you to use many different filaments with your Mini.

It can be found on Thingiverse here:

This version allows you to change the diameter of the spool by editing the .STL file.  I recommend just printing for the smallest diameter spool that you expect to use (which is likely to be the default size, already set in the file), as the larger diameter spools will slide around just fine on the smaller size arm.

## Parts
There are two parts, and an optional third.  The arm and hook are required.  To recreate them, use OpenSCAD and comment out each one to create a rendered STL for each.

In this version, I've included the plug (which holds the filament guide tube) as part of the hook.  This allows it to print in just two parts: arm and hook.  If you are using this for something separate, you can print the plug separately.

## Printing
 Use 25% infill for strength.  2 Shells is fine.  As surface finish isn't really important, using a 0.2mm layer height is satisfactory.

## Assembly
The dovetail slot should be glued with exoxy, and allowed to dry completely (usually 24 hours) before using.  The parts are very tight, and may need sanding/finishing work depending on your printer's tolerances
